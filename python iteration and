rnage iteration
my_list = [1, 2]

for v in range(2):
  my_list.insert(-1, my_list[v])

print(my_list)

range (2) means we reiterate twice on 
first iteration  of list [1,2]
v = 0 
so in mylist what has the value of [v] = 0 
it is 1 in [1,2]
 my_list = [1, >> we add 1, 2]
 my_list = [1, 1, 2]

on the second iteration 
v=1
so what is the value of v=1 in my list =  1 
my_list = [1,1,1,2]
